# Statement and Purpose
This weather app is designed to be used to help pilots identify potentially dangerous icing formations that exist in cloudy conditions.

The app works by pulling live weather data from an API, and uses that data to determine with a series of well established formulae whether or not there will be icing, and at which altitudes it is likely to occur.
